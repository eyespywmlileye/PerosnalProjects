# Personal Projects
A few personal projects I made from Jan 2022 to Sep 2022: 

> Gold Predictor => Time Series  
* Aim: Predict the futre price of gold, this is a multivariant forecasting model , it uses other macro factors that affect gold e.g the strength of the dollar , to predict the price of gold. Forecasting for stock prices can be very difficult as there are many factors to consider and thus data to gather 

> Automatic Speech Recognition => Audio Classification 
* Aim: Able to predict (from 10 words) the word spoken by anybody, it does this by processing the audio in to different forms ie. waveforms , spectograms , mel-spectrograms etc , this system can be used in the same way "Hey Siri" works, as an initiating word/phrase to activate other models, thus increasing computational efficiency 

> Object Detection
* Aim: This notebook demostrates the ability to create, train and utlise a deskop camera to create an facial detection model that can be configured for other use-cases

> Spotify Sentiment Analysis => NLP 
* Aim: Is able to categorise a music review from bad, avergae , good (0-1, 2-3, 4-5 stars) , if the user just left a comment with no rating.

> Twitter Disaster Identification => NLP
* Aim: Is able to identify if a tweet is a disaster or not, and use the information from that to make a certain tweets trend more and quicker in order to inform more people of the disaster.

> Traffic Sign Identification => Classification
* Aim: idenitfy traffic signs automatically, it can be used in self driving cars , or even normal cars to help drivers better drive (especially at night).

> 101Food => Classification
* Aim: Identify 101 classes of food just by showing the trained model a picture of the food. 

> international_airline_passengers_prediction => Basic time series 
* Aim: Very basic, it aims to forecast the number of passengers at a given time to help airlines better understand customer seasonality trends which results in better planning and overal tracking of KPIs , the dataset has a seasonality trend making it easier to train the model on the data
